# Music Information Retrieval Library
A signal processing library that extracts musical information from audio files. The library processes an audio signal as a sequence of audio frames, with variable sample length and overlap. These frames are then used to predict the frame's pitch (using autocorrelation) or calculate the MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
